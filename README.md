Usage This dataset can be used for various purposes, including: Analyzing the academic performance of individuals in different scores. Identifying trends and patterns in exams scores. Conducting statistical analysis, such as calculating averages, standard deviations, etc. Visualizing data using charts and graphs. Building predictive models based on the data.

Let's break down the columns in the dataset:
1.Gender: This column likely contains information about the gender of the individuals taking the exam. It could have values like "Male," "Female," or other gender identifiers. 2.Test Preparation Course: This column probably indicates whether the individuals took a test preparation course before the exam. It could have values like "Completed" or "None." 3.Math Score: This column contains the scores achieved by the individuals in the math section of the exam. Scores might be represented as numerical values, e.g., out of 100. 4.Reading Score: This column contains the scores achieved by the individuals in the reading section of the exam. Again, scores may be represented as numerical values, e.g., out of 100. 5.Writing Score: This column contains the scores achieved by the individuals in the writing section of the exam. As with the other scores, it may be represented as numerical values, e.g., out of 100.

FRONTEND 1.The frontend was developed by react.js. 2. The project is divided into several components, each with its specific functionality and styling. Here, we provide. documentation for the main components and their associated CSS files
Creating a Header Component in React 1.Introduction The Header component is a fundamental part of web application design. It serves as a navigational element and can display important information at the top of a web page. In this document, we will explore the creation of a simple Header component in a React application. This component is designed for a fictitious "K-Hub React Practice App." 2.Code Explanation Importing React and CSS.
1.HEADER COMPONENT: Header.js 1.It is responsible for rendering the top section of web application. 2.It uses HTML elements like and to structure the header's content and likely applies styles from an external CSS file to make it look visually appealing. 3.The header displays the text "K-Hub React Practice App" as the main heading.
Header.css 1.It is used to create a visually appealing header for a web page. It uses flexbox layout to arrange the header's sections horizontally. 2. The first section has a background color, and the main heading text inside it is styled to be white and left-aligned. 3. The second and third sections have different background colors. The widths of these sections are set relative to the viewport width to create a responsive design.
Creating a Content Component in React
2.Content Component: Content.js 1.React component fetches and displays statistical data related to car attributes as gradient bar charts. 2.It also provides information about the dataset, helping users understand the purpose and content of the data being analyzed.
Content.css 1.This code provides layout-container, left half, bar, box, right half, name, para, text area, media query. 2.They ensure that the design looks good on both larger screens and smaller screens by adjusting the layout as needed.
Creating a Footer Component in React
3.Footer Component: Footer.js 1.React Footer component displays a footer section with a GitHub link to a repository and a copyright notice. 2.It is typically used at the bottom of a web page to provide information or links relevant to the website or application.
Footer.css 1.The code should be provided like GitHub container, img src, copy right para, footer, layout container. 2. The footer and ensure that it is visually appealing and properly positioned at the bottom of the webpage. 3.The styles also provide a consistent color scheme and alignment for the footer and its contents.
App.js: This code sets up the main structure of a React application. It imports the necessary styles and components, defines the App component as the root component, and renders the HomePage component within it. The App component serves as the starting point for the application's UI. App.css: Used to style the layout, header, and some specific elements within a React application. They provide responsive design, animations, and visual styling to enhance the user experience.
FRONTEND VISUALIZATION
![TASK-1 OUTPUT](https://github.com/Deepthipenjarla/Datavisualization/assets/110033651/2b9297dd-36e6-4e66-8803-7830adec01f5)

HOME COMPONENT
The component is designed to display histograms representing statistical data related to academic performance, including mean, maximum, variance, mode, minimum, and median scores. Additionally, the component provides a brief description of the dataset being visualized.
BACKEND: THIS INFORMATION ABOUT BACKEND This is a Flask backend application that serves as an API for retrieving statistical data (mean, maximum, variance, mode, minimum, and median) related to academic performance in various subjects. It also connects to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve the data.
1.Imported Libraries:The code imports essential libraries, including Flask for building the web application, pymongo for interacting with MongoDB, Flask-CORS for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues, and the statistics module for statistical calculations. 2.Flask Application Setup:An instance of the Flask application is created, and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is enabled to allow requests from different domains. 3.calculate_statistics Function:This function takes a list of numeric values as input and calculates several statistics, including mean, mode, median, minimum, maximum, and variance. It returns these statistics in a dictionary format. 4.get_statistics Route:he /statistics route is defined, which serves as an endpoint for retrieving statistical information from the MongoDB database. 5.Main Block:The web application is started if the script is executed directly (name == 'main').
Flask Application Setup: app = Flask(name) CORS(app) The code initializes a Flask application instance and enables CORS to allow cross-origin requests. CORS is essential for allowing web applications hosted on different domains to access this API.
MongoDB Connection Setup: Frontend = mongodb://localhost:27017 This section establishes a connection to a MongoDB database. This is where academic performance data will be stored.
Running the Flask Application: if name == 'main': app.run(debug=True) This section ensures that the Flask application is run only when the script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module. It starts the application in debug mode, which is useful for development. This code sets up a Flask API for retrieving statistical data from a MongoDB database and provides endpoints to access different statistical measures. To use this backend, you need to have a CSV file with academic performance data and ensure that MongoDB is running locally.
